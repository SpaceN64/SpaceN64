## Sup — I'm SpaceN64 👨‍💻

I'm a Python programmer and an HTML writer from Canada 🇨🇦.

_At the moment, I am trying to learn more about *HTML* and *Java* and expanding my (already vast) knowledge of *Python*!_

## ***Some Skills I Have in Python 🐍***
- Have mastered the basics of Python
- Can create modules with multiple classes to efficiently and effectively simplify code
- Can create servers, API connectors, etc programs with ease  
- Can create a standalone _"application"_ which can virtually execute its designated function

**My main IDE is Visual Studio Code, but I am comfortable with Pycharm, terminal, and many more**

## My Announcements 📣
